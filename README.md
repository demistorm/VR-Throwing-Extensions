Minecraft mod allowing Vivecraft players to throw and catch any item!
Available on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/vr-throwing-extensions) and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/vr-throwing-extensions).

Simply hold the attack/destroy keybind, make a throwing motion, and release!
Hold the place/use keybind at the same time to throw the whole stack. 

To catch a thrown item, reach towards it with an empty hand and simply hold the attack/destroy keybind. Like an opposite throw!

There are multiple weapon effects, **boomerang**, **embedding**, and **off**. The boomerang effect will have weapons/tools arc back to their origin after colliding with an mob/player (default setting). Embedding will embed any weapon or tool that does more than 1 damage into the entity it hit and apply a bleeding effect doing 1 damage every 1.5 seconds. Great against creepers! Off will simply make the weapon drop on impact, similarly to throwing a regular item like dirt. 

---

#### Server Owners:
The serverside configuration is authoritative for the weapon effect and aim assist options. Whatever you set there will be what the mod does for everyone. Weapon Effect options are OFF | BOOMERANG | EMBED. 

Aim Assist is simply true | false.
